Here, we present a model of drifted Brownian Motion that considers a nonlinear stochastic drift with constant or fluctuating diffusivity. The interplay between nonlinearity and structural heterogeneity of the environment can explain three essential features of active transport. These features, which are commonly observed in experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, include transient superdiffusion, ephemeral non-Gaussian displacement distribution, and non-monotonic evolution of non-Gaussian parameter. Our results compare qualitatively well with experiments of self-propelled particles in simple hydrogen peroxide solutions and molecular dynamics simulations of self-propelled particles in more complex settings such as viscoelastic polymeric media.","tags":null,"title":"Stochastically drifted Brownian motion for self-propelled particles","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Nikolaos K.

The terminal valleys at the bottom of the hill indicate the possible committed cells of the multicellular organism. Although originally proposed as a metaphor, Waddington’s hypothesis establishes the fundamental principles for characterizing the differentiation process as a dynamic system: the generated equilibrium points must exhibit hierarchical branching, robustness to perturbations (homeorhesis), and produce the appropriate number of cells for each cell type. This article aims to capture these characteristics using a mathematical model based on two fundamental hypotheses. First, it is assumed that the gene regulatory network consists of hierarchically coupled subnetworks of genes (modules), each modeled as a dynamical system exhibiting supercritical pitchfork or cusp bifurcation. Second, the gene modules are spatiotemporally regulated by feedback mechanisms originating from epigenetic factors. Analytical and numerical results show that the proposed model exhibits self-organized multistability with hierarchical branching. Moreover, these branches of equilibrium points are robust to perturbations, and the number of different cells produced can be determined by the system parameters.","tags":null,"title":"Hierarchical Symmetry-Breaking Model for Stem Cell Differentiation","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Nikolaos K.

Such properties cannot be adequately explained by the original theory of Brownian motion. Based on an extension of kinetic theory, this study introduces a chain of hierarchically coupled random walks approach that effectively captures all these intriguing characteristics. If the environment consists of a series of independent white noise sources, then the problem can be expressed as a system of hierarchically coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbech equations.

This transition may occur by varying a control parameter that represents the intrinsic noise of the system. It has been suggested that stem cell differentiation can be considered as a sequence of such symmetry-breaking events. Pluripotent stem cells, with their capacity to develop into any specialized cell type, are considered highly symmetric systems. In contrast, differentiated cells have lower symmetry, as they can only carry out a limited number of functions. For this hypothesis to be valid, differentiation should emerge collectively in stem cell populations. Additionally, such populations must have the ability to self-regulate intrinsic noise and navigate through a critical point where spontaneous symmetry breaking (differentiation) occurs. This study presents a mean-field model for stem cell populations that considers the interplay of cell–cell cooperativity, cell-to-cell variability, and finite-size effects. By introducing a feedback mechanism to control intrinsic noise, the model can self-tune through different bifurcation points, facilitating spontaneous symmetry breaking. Standard stability analysis showed that the system can potentially differentiate into several cell types mathematically expressed as stable nodes and limit cycles. The existence of a Hopf bifurcation in our model is discussed in light of stem cell differentiation.","tags":null,"title":"Self-Regulated Symmetry Breaking Model for Stem Cell Differentiation","type":"publications"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1681929856,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1681929856,"objectID":"c3340cd215f178f57fcd2a04ee8fa88f","permalink":"https://nvoul.github.io/post/congratulations-madelynn/","publishdate":"2023-04-19T11:44:16-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/congratulations-madelynn/","section":"post","summary":"Congratulations to Madelynn McElroy for joining the PhD program in Bioengineering at University of Maryland at College Park!

The differentiation process consists of a series of symmetry-breaking events, starting from a high-symmetry state (stem cells) to a low-symmetry state (specialized cells). This scenario closely resembles phase transitions in statistical mechanics. To theoretically study this hypothesis, we model embryonic stem cell (ESC) populations through a coupled Boolean network (BN) model. The interaction is applied using a multilayer Ising model that considers paracrine and autocrine signaling, along with external interventions. It is demonstrated that cell-to-cell variability can be interpreted as a mixture of steady-state probability distributions. Simulations have revealed that such models can undergo a series of first- and second-order phase transitions as a function of the system parameters that describe gene expression noise and interaction strengths. These phase transitions result in spontaneous symmetry-breaking events that generate new types of cells characterized by various steady-state distributions. Coupled BNs have also been shown to self-organize in states that allow spontaneous cell differentiation.","tags":null,"title":"Emergent Criticality in Coupled Boolean Networks","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Kellan Toman","Nikolaos K.

We implemented the fluctuating hydrodynamics framework to model the diffusion of the chemical species in the fluid domain, and the chemical master equation to describe the catalytic activity at the interface. The coupling between the domains occurs simultaneously. Using a simple one-dimensional (1D) linear model, we showed that the predictions of our scheme are in excellent agreement with deterministic simulations. The method was specifically developed to model the spatially asymmetric catalysis on the surface of self-propelled nanoswimmers. Numerical simulations showed that our approach can estimate the uncertainty in the swimming velocity resulting from inherent stochastic nature of the chemical reactions at the catalytic interface. Although the method has been applied to simple 1D and 2D models, it can be generalized to handle different geometries and more sophisticated chemical reactions. Therefore, it can serve as a practical mathematical tool to study how the efficiency of chemically powered nanomachines is affected by the interplay between structural complexity, nonlinear reactivity, and nonequilibrium fluctuations.","tags":null,"title":"A hybrid fluctuating hydrodynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo method for modeling chemically-powered nanoscale motion","type":"publications"},{"authors":["N.K.

Vital functions of DNA, such as transcription and packaging, depend on the proper clustering of proteins on the double strand. The present study investigates how the interplay between DNA allostery and electrostatic interactions affects protein clustering. The statistical analysis of a simple but transparent computational model reveals two major consequences of this interplay. First, depending on the protein and salt concentration, protein filaments exhibit a bimodal DNA stiffening and softening behavior. Second, within a certain domain of the control parameters, electrostatic interactions can cause energetic frustration that forces proteins to assemble in rigid spiral configurations. Such spiral filaments might trigger both positive and negative supercoiling, which can ultimately promote gene compaction and regulate the promoter. It has been experimentally shown that bacterial histone-like proteins assemble in similar spiral patterns and/or exhibit the same bimodal behavior. The proposed model can, thus, provide computational insights into the physical mechanisms used by proteins to control the mechanical properties of the DNA.","tags":null,"title":"A stochastic reaction-diffusion model for protein aggregation on DNA","type":"publications"},{"authors":["L.

All rights reserved. Allostery through DNA is increasingly recognized as an important modulator of DNA functions. Here, we show that the coalescence of protein-induced DNA bubbles can mediate allosteric interactions that drive protein aggregation. We propose that such allostery may regulate DNA's flexibility and the assembly of the transcription machinery. Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), a dual-function protein involved in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) packaging and transcription initiation, is an ideal candidate to test such a hypothesis owing to its ability to locally unwind the double helix. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the coalescence of TFAM-induced bubbles can explain experimentally observed TFAM oligomerization. The resulting melted DNA segment, approximately 10 base pairs long, around the joints of the oligomers act as flexible hinges, which explains the efficiency of TFAM in compacting DNA. Since mitochondrial polymerase (mitoRNAP) is involved in melting the transcription bubble, TFAM may use the same allosteric interaction to both recruit mitoRNAP and initiate transcription.","tags":null,"title":"Allostery through protein-induced DNA bubbles","type":"publications"},{"authors":["H.

The hydrodynamic representation considered in this work is based on the equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics (FH). The essence of this method is a mapping from the position and velocity vectors of a snapshot of a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to the field variables on Eulerian cells of a hydrodynamic representation. By explicit consideration of the effective lengthscale dmol that characterizes the volume of a molecule, the computed density fluctuations from MD via our mapping procedure have volume dependence that corresponds to a grand canonical ensemble of a cold liquid even when a small cell length (5-10 Å) is used in a hydrodynamic representation. For TIP3P water at 300 K and 1 atm, dmol is found to be 2.4 Å, corresponding to the excluded radius of a water molecule as revealed by its center-of-mass radial distribution function. By matching the density fluctuations and autocorrelation functions of momentum fields computed from solving the FH equations with those computed from MD simulation, the sound velocity and shear and bulk viscosities of a CG hydrodynamic model can be determined directly from MD. Furthermore, a novel staggered discretization scheme is developed for solving the FH equations of an isothermal compressive fluid in a three dimensional space with a central difference method. This scheme demonstrates high accuracy in satisfying the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Since the causative relationship between field variables and fluxes is captured, we demonstrate that the staggered discretization scheme also predicts correct physical behaviors in simulating transient fluid flows.

The widely used linear Maxwell model is employed as a working choice; other models can be used as well. For a fluid that is Newtonian in the macroscopic limit, this approach results in a parallel Newtonian-Maxwell model. For water, argon, and an ionic liquid, the power spectrum of momentum field autocorrelation functions of the parallel Newtonian-Maxwell model agrees very well with those calculated from all-atom MD simulations. To incorporate thermal fluctuations, we generalize the equations of FHD to work with non-Markovian rheological models and colored noise. The fluctuating stress tensor (white noise) is integrated in time in the same manner as its dissipative counterpart and numerical simulations indicate that this approach accurately preserves the set temperature in a FHD simulation. By mapping position and velocity vectors in the molecular representation onto field variables, we bridge the non-Markovian FHD with atomistic MD simulations. Through this mapping, we quantitatively determine the transport coefficients of the parallel Newtonian-Maxwell model for water and argon from all-atom MD simulations. For both fluids, a significant enhancement in elastic responses is observed as the wave number of hydrodynamic modes is reduced to a few nanometers. The mapping from particle to field representations and the perturbative strategy of developing constitutive equations provide a useful framework for modeling the nanoscale viscoelasticity of fluids. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.","tags":null,"title":"Modeling the nanoscale viscoelasticity of fluids by bridging non-Markovian fluctuating hydrodynamics and molecular dynamics simulations","type":"publications"},{"authors":["B.

The secondary structure of the β-sheet proteins is modelled by a two-dimensional oscillator network whose constituents represent peptide units. Covalent and hydrogen bonds between the peptide units are represented by point-point interaction potentials. Intrapeptide vibrational degrees of freedom are taken into account by means of harmonic oscillators while the electronic motion is described within the framework of a tight-binding system. We construct polarons as stationary localized solution states utilizing a non-linear map approach. The polaron state represents a self-trapped electron in conjunction with its intrapeptide deformation field and the static deformation of the protein scaffolding. Furthermore, in the dynamical study we focus attention on the initiation of polaron motion, utilizing its pinning modes. We show that both the covalent and the hydrogen channel provide a path for coherent ET in β-sheet proteins. It is demonstrated that the interplay of the vibrations of the protein scaffolding and the electron dynamics promotes long-lived localized excitation patterns travelling coherently along the lattice of peptide units.","tags":null,"title":"Polaronic electron transfer in β-sheet protein models","type":"publications"},{"authors":["N.K.
