	abstract = {We discuss connections between the nonlinear dynamics of double-stranded DNA,
experimental findings, and specific DNA functions. We begin by discussing how thermally
induced localized openings (bubbles) of the DNA double strand are important for
interpreting dynamic force spectroscopy data. Then we demonstrate a correlation between
a sequence-dependent propensity for pre-melting bubble formation and transcription
initiation and other regulatory effects in viral DNA. Finally, we discuss the possibility of a
connection between DNA dynamics and the ability of repair proteins to recognize
ultraviolet (UV) radiation damage sites.}
