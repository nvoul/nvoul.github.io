	abstract = {We consider electron transfer (ET) along β-sheet forms of
proteins.  The secondary structure of the β-sheet proteins
is modelled by a two-dimensional oscillator network whose
constituents represent peptide units.  Covalent and hydrogen bonds
between the peptide units are represented by point-point
interaction potentials.  Intrapeptide vibrational degrees of freedom
are taken into account by means of harmonic oscillators while the
electronic motion is described within the framework of a
tight-binding system.  We construct polarons as stationary localized
solution states utilizing a non-linear map approach.  The polaron
state represents a self-trapped electron in conjunction with its
intrapeptide deformation field and the static deformation of the
protein scaffolding.  Furthermore, in the dynamical study we focus
attention on the initiation of polaron motion, utilizing its pinning
modes.  We show that both the covalent and the hydrogen channel
provide a path for coherent ET in β-sheet proteins.  It is
demonstrated that the interplay of the vibrations of the protein
scaffolding and the electron dynamics promotes long-lived localized
excitation patterns travelling coherently along the lattice of
peptide units.}
